<h1>MY GOALS:</h1>
    <div>
    <img class="textwrap" src="img/aboutme.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="mikaneuparth" />
    </div>
<p>My name is Mika Neuparth, and I am in the beginning stages of preparing for law school. Right now, I am enrolled in an LSAT class that consumes the majority of my time, and the rest of my time is scattered between schoolwork (to ensure that I get straight A's for law school) and my part-time job. Over this past summer, I was blessed with the opportunity to intern with the legal department for GeoGroup Inc. at their main world headquarters office in Boca Raton, Florida. This internship was a great reminder of how fortunate I am to be a part of such a phenomenal Journalism department at the University of Florida, where the professors care so much about the amount learned. To survive in the legal world one needs to be able to write exceptionally well, and I feel that my professors are effectively equipping me for the real world. However, this internship also showed me how little I really know about the legal world. It also prompted me to think that there is a huge difference in what I want to know and what I actually know. At this moment in time, I don't feel qualified to continuously post on a blog about how these two subjects of journalism and law relate and effect each other.</p>
<br>
<h1>JUST A LITTLE ABOUT ME:</h1>
<p>To begin, I was born in Portugal and because of that, I am very close with my family over there. My father is a pilot and because of this I was blessed with a life of getting to see the world. I took my first international flight at 8 months old and ever since that time, I have taken about three to four trips every year, sometimes back to Portugal and other times to random countries that sparked my parents' interest. By age 12, I had mastered the art of traveling and my parents sent me and my younger sister (8 at the time) off on an international flight by ourselves, where we would have to catch a connecting flight from Miami to Newark to Lisbon. The following year, I became so interested in the process, I watched my dad as he booked flights for his company, as well as for our family during his vacation time. At 16, I helped to organize a church missions trip to Costa Rica for two weeks, including everything from booking flights and hostels to planning the itinerary for the group of 35 people. I had such an amazing time that I decided to lead up the missions trip back to Costa Rica the following year.</p>
<p>Some of the places I have been include Portugal, Spain, Italy, France, England, Mexico, and all over the United States. My next destination will hopefully be to Brazil, maybe even for the World Cup in 2014! I would also love to go on a cruise one day, I think that would be a completely different experience of travel.</p>
<br>
<h1>SOME OTHER INTERESTS:</h1>
<p>As a hobby, I also really love photography. I don't think that I will ever incorporate this into the field of law that I would like to practice, however, it keeps me entertained for now. It began by taking pictures of places as I traveled and saw new things, and then developed into portrait photography when I realized that I loved working with people. Maybe one day I will be able to incorporate portrait photography with traveling, just for fun.</p>
<br>
<h1>THE PURPOSE OF THIS WEBSITE:</h1>
<p>Maybe one day after I graduate law school, I will be able to run a blog helping others to get through the excruciating process. Until then, I will reflect upon my other interests that I am well versed in. I love to travel and I hope to incorporate this into my future career. For these reasons, I have decided that, through this blog, I want to continue this interest, share my experiences with others, and possibly even share some advice about traveling.</p>
<p>However, this website was mostly created to display my journalistic skills for future potential employers, and this not only includes photography, but also multimedia, writing, and some graphic design (as shown by my logo). We all know that nowadays it takes more than just great writing skills to be successful in the field: many employers except you to be a master of all trades. Hopefully, this website will also be helpful for my peers and other growing journalists, as I hope to also incorporate some expert advice onto this website from some mentors of mine throughout my years here at UF!</p>
