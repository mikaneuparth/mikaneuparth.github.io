    <h1>NEW YORK</h1>
    <br><br>

    <p>This past summer, I traveled to New York and Washington D.C. to visit potential law schools. My trip was absolutely incredible. I got to wander around Washington Square Park in New York, which would be a dream come true to be able to study there every day.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Although I am so very thankful for the wonderful opportunities that the University of Florida has provided me with, I think it is time for me to start the search into the next part of my life journey.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One of the hardest things for me about Gainesville is that I feel that there is barely any subculture here. I understand that this is a college town, and the majority of college students are only interested in drinking, however, it would be nice if we had some other form of entertainment.</p>
    <br>
    <p>New York provides a scene with many subcultures, such as the appreciation for live music and broadway plays. However, this is not to say that New York doesn't party. We all know New York City to be the city that never sleeps.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I've taken many trips to New York as a child, most of them layovers on the way to Europe. I have seen the dirt and the grime of New York City. However, in my mind, New York just has the best of both worlds. The beach and boardwalk of Coney Island would help me to not miss the beaches at home so much, and I would still get the rush of that big city feel. And the best part of all - New York has seasons, I would actually get to enjoy winter and summer.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There were also some negative aspects of my visit to New York. I was not impressed with the law school buildings and structures themselves. They seemed outdated and small. Comparatively, I would much rather spend my time at the UF law library than at the law library of NYU. I have no idea what is in store for me in the future, however, I will say that I definitely enjoyed this trip to New York.</p>
      <br><br><br><br>
<h1>BARCELONA, SPAIN</h1>   
    <br><br>
    <div>
        <img class="textwrap" src="img/barceloname.jpg" width="200" height="330" alt="mikaneuparth" />
    </div>
    <p>If you enjoy seeing places, I would definitely recommend seeing Barri Gotic, which is a plaza that encompasses the darker historical ages of Spain while combining the newer elements of shopping and dining. The magic fountain of Montjuic is also very entertaining at night due to its enormity as well as the light show. It is a very large social gathering and turns into a sort of festive atmosphere when the sun sets. If you are looking for relaxing activities that don’t require much effort, you can take a lift to the top of Tibidabo Mountain that overlooks the entire city and is a gorgeous view. (If you’re looking for something more active, you can also treck your way to the top by hiking!) You can also drive along the beautiful coast and end up at Park Guell, which was my personal favorite place of Barcelona because it was all mosaic and was made by Antoni Gaudi.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you enjoy viewing art museums, two of the greatest exist in Barcelona: the museum of Gaudi and Picasso, both of which are relatively cheap and offer a variety of exhibitions. Outside of these exhibits is where most of the artistic graffiti exists, which can be quite interesting and beautiful if you choose to look at it as art rather than vandalism. My favorite building to see was most obviously La Sagrada Familia because of its intricacy and background information about the amount of architects that it took to complete this masterpiece that is still in progress.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you are looking for some more adventurous night activities, this is definitely my forte. I booked this vacation around the Copa del Rey soccer game specifically because I wanted to see Barcelona vs Real Madrid (because Cristiano Ronaldo plays for this team), however, FB Barcelona usually has some sort of game (even if it is a friendly match) that you can see and the tickets will be relatively inexpensive. The most culturally interesting spectator sports would be to go to a bullfight (which I thoroughly enjoy and have been to 5) or watching Flamenco dancing along with dinner (which is very typical of the Catalan culture). Beware, bull fights may be a bit gruesome to watch and handle because they do repeatedly stab the bull and it bleeds, however, when looked at as a cultural art form, it is one of the most interesting things I have ever watched (although I love the art of Portuguese bullfighting much better because it is much more thrilling and dangerous). Barcelona is a wonderful city and I fully enjoyed my time spent there.</p>
