    <p>Satchel's Pizza Recovers From Fire: Summer 2012</p>
    <br>
    <p>This was my first multimedia project that I ever created and I think that it is important to be displayed on my website for two reasons: </p>
    <p>1. It shows a result that is simplistic and an attainable goal for someone new to multimedia journalism.</p>
    <p>2. It shows a lot of rough patches, and I can use this to critique myself, but also to look back and see how far I have come in my multimedia success.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This piece was created for JOU3346L, otherwise known as the one-credit corequisit to Reporting that is way too time consuming and distracting from a class that we all want A's in. However, I will say that this story was one of the most fun pieces that I've ever reported. There were so many people just doing quick interviews of Satchel's at the time due to all the news media. But, because I showed a little more interest, they took me in and let me have free reign around the kitchen and working areas to take pictures and video.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The employees of Satchel's Pizza are some of the most loyal and nicest people I will probabl ever meet, and because of this experience alone, I will always be thankful for the worthless corequisit to Reporting.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It also helped me to realize that in order to report well, you also need social skills. I got to know the employees pretty well, and I believe that contributed to the way the piece was told.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Similarly to the Satchel's story, I also got to know the boys of this band very well. These are indeed very talented musicians with a lot of enthusiasm and uniqueness, enough to succeed.</p>
    <br>
    <p>At the time, before Farah's On The Avenue closed down, I was working there part time. They played their first ever 'gig' at Farah's and I knew I wanted to scoop up this story of the up and coming band before anyone else did.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In the end, we grew to have such a relationship that they chose me to be a psuedo PR advisor. They liked my ideas enough to allow me to construct a band poster and take the picture for the album cover and album insert. I used all sorts of skills for this project, and this was when I first realized that people really do expect journalists to be able to do more than just write. They didn't just want a story in the newspaper. They wanted my help with photography, video promotions, band logos, public relations advising, and much more. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The best news of all is that I have presented this website to them almost as a prototype, and they told me that they liked it so much they would be willing to pay me to create a band website for them. They would want a similar set up; with photos from their shows as well as multimedia, and articles about them to keep them in everyone's line of vision.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It has been a very unique experience for me because I got to see them play their first paid show, and they are now providing me with my first paid job relating to the journalism field.</p>

    <p>On April 5, Farah’s on the Avenue discovered the band Pristine Stringz, which was recently ranked the number one orchestral duet in Gainesville. The following week, the band was debuting their first album at Farah’s named Pristine Nation and playing their first paid gig.</p> 
	<p>Lauren Farley, restaurant manager, said that Farah’s had been looking for a band to play regularly on Saturday nights and “just happened upon Pristine Stringz one day when they were playing outside in downtown Gainesville.”</p>
	<p>“I’m not going to pretend that I don’t want to get paid to play my music,” said Ben Derrico, cellist of Pristine Stringz. “I’m happy that Farah’s decided to take a chance with us. It gave me hope that I could actually make a living out of my music.”</p>
	<p>Ben Derrico and Quinn Bass, both Gainesville locals, played together for the first time at an open mic night at Coffee Culture by Gainesville High School about two years ago. Since then, the two of them have formed a band, made a name for themselves around Gainesville, and hired a producer to record an album.</p>
	 <p>Derrico, 16, has been playing the cello since the age of three and his partner Quinn Bass, 17, has been playing the violin since the age of five. Bass said that he didn’t really want to play in front of people at the open mic night at first, but he “just loved the reaction he got out of people” and it really encouraged him to be serious about their music as a band.</p>
	<p>“After that, we began writing their own music and it progressed to what it is now,” said Bass. “Last week we just dropped our debut mix tape called Pristine Nation. Their music is now featured on iTunes, Spotify, Pandora, Facebook, Amazon MP3 and all around Gainesville. Some of the places that they can be found at are Farah’s on Saturday nights, Coffee Culture on Sunday nights, Tupelo Bar and Grill, Tasty Buddha, and The Jam.</p> 
	<p>“When we started the band, one of our big goals was to get the younger generation involved in classical music through combining it with the modern elements of hip-hop and rock,” said Bass. “And we also wanted to help encourage kids to get involved with music in their school. I really think that’s an essential part of education.”</p>
	<p>Thomas Swanson is the producer of Pristine Stringz at the moment and has helped launch their debut album. He also edited and added a bass and drum line as well as a synthesizer onto the tracks through a DJ mixing computer software. Swanson was recently ranked the number producer in Gainesville by the Gainesville Sun.</p>
	<p>At this moment in time, Pristine Stringz is working on writing new music and hopefully trying to incorporate a female singer into the songs if it can all be put together in time. They also just hired a director last week to film a music video to put on Vevo. Thomas Swanson believes “big things are coming their way. They’ve put a lot of time into their music and now they’re reaping the benefits. They’re talented kids and I really believe they could go all the way with this new sound that they’re created.”</p>
